This is the main SloTex NLP project which joins all project modules and also includes
project user and developer documentation, project's web page, and all other
necessary info to use or contribute to SloTex NLP in your own environment. 


== Project details
SloTex is a project under which Slovene language-technology solutions for the use in business information systems will
be developed.

The project started in February 2019 and will be completed by July 2019.

On this website, you can always track our progress. We will do our best to keep you updated about the project progress.

== Project goals
High-tech companies nowadays use language technologies in business environments. Language technologies are embedded in
applications that enable the processing of large amount of data.
Today, there are many open source frameworks on the market that enable the use of language technologies for many languages.
Since Slovene has a relatively small number of speakers and consequently lower market relevance, it is often neglected.

Our goal is to transfer know-how for application development, which includes several open-source frameworks of language
technologies,
and the adaptation of these technologies for the Slovene language.

World-famous open source software tools and frameworks will be used in our project, with the goal to develop an
 application for Slovene intended
for both linguists as well as anyone else who is interested in information extraction from a written text.
The application for business applications developed in this project will enable users to use advanced neutral language
modeling in Slovene and English within
open source frameworks that enable machine learning of models in Slovenian texts for the purposes of:

* language detection,
* sentence recognition,
* morphological tagging,
* lemmatization,
* syntax parser and
* named entity recognition.

=== Named entity recognition

Our priority and the first task was to develop a named entity recognition tool that could be used for commercial purposes.
Named entity recognition (NER) also known as entity identification or entity extraction is a subtask of information extraction that locates and classifies named entities from texts. Currently, there are many defined catogories
of named entites, such as person names, organizations, locations.
In our project, we used Apache openNLP, a machine learning based toolkit for the processing of natural language.
It supports most common NLP tasks, such as tokenization,
sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition.

== Named entity recognition for Slovene - problems and challenges
Slovene is intentionally rich language, meaning that the form of names changes is every case. Since there are
six cases in Slovene (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, locative and instrumental), each named entity can appear
 in at least six forms.

This can be seen in the following example. According to the Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia,
the most common name in Slovenia in the year 2018 was Franc.

So, let's take "Franc", the most common masculine name, to show how this named entity changes in all the cases.

Nominative = Franc

Genitive = Franca

Dative = Francu

Accusative = Franca

Locative = Francu

Instrumental = Francem

As you can see, the form of the entity is in almost all cases different. This is what makes NER for Slovene a bit harder,
 since other languages, such as English or German, do not
know inflectional forms of names.
However, these are not the only inflectional forms of the name Franc.
There are also six forms in dual and 6 other forms in plural.
Altogether, there are 18 inflectional forms of a single named entity in Slovene language.

All forms of the name Franc can be seen in the following table.

.Inflections in Slovene
|===
|Case|Singular|Dual|Plural
|Nominative|Franc|Franca|Franci
|Genitive|Franca|Francev|Francev
|Dative|Francu|Francema|Francem
|Accusative|Franca|Franca|France
|Locative|Francu|Francih|Francih
|Instrumental|Francem|Francema|Franci
|===


So one of the core problems of NER tool development was to learn the tool to recognize
also inflectional forms of names as named entities.

== External knowledge resources
Named entity recognition should be trained on corpus or on a large text database. For that purposes we built
a corpora, data for which were taken from the website link:http://lit.ijs.si/leposl.html[Slovene literature online].
Here you can find collected Slovene literature works online. You can search and read works, written by famous Slovene
writers and poets, such as link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentin_Vodnik[Valentin Vodnik],
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_Pre%C5%A1eren[France Prešeren],
 link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Levstik[Fran Levstik] and many others.
 Our corpora contains 109.193‬ sentences and approximately 1,200,000 words.

[red]#Normalization#

The second step was text normalization. This is a process that converts a list of words to a more uniform sequence.
 This step is very useful for later text processing and for easier and quicker searching process.

First, we extracted all abbreviations, such as "itd." (ect) and npr. (e.g.). All together, we defined 995 abbreviations
 that needed to be extracted. The list of all abbreviations can be found on
 link:https://github.com/aljaz-trebusak/ApacheOpenNLP-SloTex/tree/master/Documents/resources[GitHub].

[red]#Levenshtein#

In order to improve our model, we applied the method based on Levenshtein distance.
Levenshtein's Edit Distance algorithm is frequently used to calculate the edit distance between any two strings in the
same language. In our project, we used it to measure the distance between lemmas of named entities and their
non-lemma forms. Under non-lemma forms of Slovene named entities, we understand nouns and possessive adjectives
that are inflected. Meaning, the Levenshtein distance is actually the number of single-character edits between the words,
 in our case between lemmas and inflectional forms. As a single-character edit we understand every insertion, deletion
 or substitution that ist required to change the inflectional form into lemma or vice versa.
With Levenshtein distance, we trained our model to measeure if two entities that are written in different
cases are actually the same named entity.

For example, with Levenshtein distance, we trained our model to recognize the entity "Markov" as the inflectional form of
the name "Marko".

An examle that features the comparison of "Marko" and "Markov" can be seen in the next table:

.Inflections in Slovene
|===
|Case|Singular|Dual|Plural
|Nominative|Franc|Franca|Franci
|Genitive|Franca|Francev|Francev
|Dative|Francu|Francema|Francem
|Accusative|Franca|Franca|France
|Locative|Francu|Francih|Francih
|Instrumental|Francem|Francema|Franci
|===

Our model was trained to recognize two entities as the same word in different cases
if the distance between them was lower than xy.



For the project we used database of Slovene names that we got on the website of link:https://www.stat.si/statweb/en[the
Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia].

== Project founders

The program PKP or Po kreativni poti do praktičnega znanja or Taking a creative path to practical knowledge connects
 universities and commercial partners and thus allows students to gain experience in the field, additional knowledge
 and abilities which are increasingly more important when entering a job market and starting a career. Students research
  creative and innovative solutions to challenges posed by the economy and society.

The program cofinances projects lasting from 3 to 5 months that include 4 to 8 students and their mentors.
SloTex is one of 133 projects participating in the second opening of the project between the years of 2017 and 2020.
