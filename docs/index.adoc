The project started in February 2019 and will be completed by July 2019.

On this website, you can always track our progress. We will do our best to keep you updated about the project process.


== Project goals
High-tech companies nowadays use language technologies in business environments. Language technologies are embedded in aplications that enable the processing of large amount of data.
Today, there are many open source frameworks on the market that enable the use of language technologies for many languages.
Since Slovene has a relatively small number of speakers and consequently lower market relevance, it is often neglected.

Our goal is to transfer know-how for application development, which includes several open-source frameworks of language technologies,
and the adaptation of these technologies for the Slovene language.

World-famous open source software tools and frameworks will be used in our project, with the goal to develop an application for Slovene intended
for both linguists as well as anyone else who is interested in information extraction from a written text.
The application for business applications developed in this project will enable users to use advanced neutral language modeling in Slovene and English within
open source frameworks that enable machine learning of models in Slovenian texts for the purposes of:

* language detection,
* sentence recognition,
* morphological tagging,
* lemmatization,
* syntax parser and
* entity recognition.
